# Dummy Tests
---
### A simple header only test library to test functionalities in small C++ codes.
---
### The project only relies on the C++ Standard Template Library.

## History
---
This small library consisting of some macros, some variables, an unordered map and a function, contained in [DummyTest.h](./DummyTests/DummyTests.h) is never meant for any actual test work. There are actual libraries that do these work. This header file was originally created so that I could automate checking some C++ programming related tasks in my lab classes. To understand how to write a simple test source program, just take a look at [Test.cpp](./Test.cpp).

This library might even break at the simplest cases and might not even be able to do trivial things, like testing for a series of values via a loop. However, it can be easily extended to support those.
